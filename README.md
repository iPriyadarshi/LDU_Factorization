# LDU_Factorization
## LDU Factorization of an n*n Matrix
### Overview
This project provides a web-based tool to perform LDU (Lower-Diagonal-Upper) factorization of an n\*n matrix. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it allows users to input a matrix, visualize the steps of the factorization process, and see the resulting L, D, and U matrices.

### Features
- **Matrix Input**: Dynamically generate a matrix input form based on user-defined matrix size.

- **Detailed Steps**: Display each step of the LDU factorization process.

- **Result Visualization**: Show the resulting L, D, and U matrices after factorization.

### Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iPriyadarshi/LDU_factorization.git
cd LDU_factorization
```

2. **Open `index.html` in a web browser**:
      
```bash
open index.html
```
### Usage
**1. Matrix Size:** Enter the desired matrix size (n) in the input field.

**2. Generate Matrix:** Click the "Generate Matrix" button to create the input form for the matrix.

**3. Input Matrix Elements:** Fill in the elements of the matrix.

**4. Factorize:** Click the "Factorize" button to perform the LDU factorization. The detailed steps and results will be displayed below.

### Project Structure
- [index.html](index.html): The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web application.

- [style.css](style.css): The CSS file for styling the web application.

- [script.js](script.js): The JavaScript file that contains the logic for LDU factorization and user interactions.
